\section{Introduction}

Our task was to implement a simple distributed key-value store.


\subsection{Requirements}

% TODO: Multiple nodes.
% TODO: Frontend node connects randomly.

\if 0

\begin{itemize} 
\item Design and implement a distributed key-value storage system
\item Run the system on the uvocks cluster (urocks.cs.uit.no)
\end{itemize}

\fi


\section{Technical Background}

\if 0

\begin{itemize} 
\item[--] Distributed systems concept
\item[--] Basic programming approach
\item[--] Knowledge of Python language
\item[--] Notion of design pattern principles
\item[--] Theory about software engineering
\item[--] Knowledge of git to manage the software versions
\item[--] Notion of Chord architecture
\item[--] Knowledge of programming with API in Python
\item[--] Basic approach to Linux command line principles
\end{itemize}

The interesting thing about DHTs is that storage and lookups are distributed among multiple machines \cite{linuxjournal_dht}
Chord is an efficient distributed lookup system based on consistent hashing. It provides a
unique mapping between an identifier space and a set of nodes \cite{chord}
\newline
Chord is efficient: determining the successor of an identifier requires that $O(log N)$ messages be exchanged with high probability where $N$ is the number of servers in the
Chord network. Adding or removing a server from the network
can be accomplished, with high probability, at a cost of $O(log^2 N)$ messages.
\cite{chord}
\fi


\section{Design}

% TODO: Chord's one-dimensional key-space, without finger tables.
% TODO: Nodes fixed, so key space divided evenly.
% TODO: How to block. Synchronous at first.


\section{Implementation}

% TODO: Existing frontend in Python
% TODO: Shell script to start
% TODO: HTTP API

\if
Implemented on the file \textit{startup.sh} the possibility to choose with a given argument how many nodes to run. Since the Linux's bash works as a pipeline, each command has been given using the input of the output of the previous one, and at the end it gets the random nodes on the cluster according to a number given in input while executing the script.
\begin{lstlisting}
nodes = 
$(rocks list host |
grep compute |
cut -d" " -f1 |
sed 's/.$//' |
shuf |
head -n "$num_hosts")
\end{lstlisting}
\fi



\section{Discussion}

% TODO: O(n) lookup.
% TODO: Finger tables O(log n)



\section{Evaluation}

% TODO: time actual implementation


\section{Conclusion}
